Each player has one card. <br><br>


Each card has two sides, the coloured side denotes an actor, YOUR actor. The text side entails the ‘reality’ your actor is a part of - as the heading - as well as a list of other actors from this reality. <br><br>


The aim of the game is for each player to follow the evolution of the narrative unfolding on the screen and intervene on the outcome of the narrative in order to encounter all of the actors on their list by the end of the narrative. <br><br>


The narrative, which will appear on the screen, has many different arcs - each prioritising a different reality and its actors. In order to complete your list, you must try and steer the narrative in the direction most beneficial to your reality. However you can only intervene when the actor presented on the coloured side of your card appears on the screen as a possible choice for the story.<br><br>


When you spot this, try and be the first one to call out your preferred option, while showing the actor side of your card. The first player to do this will be able to determine which way the story goes. <br><br>


Throughout the story, try and spot the different actors in your reality (written in pink) and cross them off your list. Other players in the room may have the same actor or reality card as you and will be playing for your reality, even if you don’t know it. <br><br>
